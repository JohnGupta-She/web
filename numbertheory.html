<h2>Number Theory</h2>
<p>Number Theory has always been sort of a struggle for me. It has so many different ideas and concepts that are all relatively hard, so I often have trouble keeping up. It also has a lot of application in the real world, so it is really important. One famous example is the use of Fermat's little theorem and Euler's totient functions as a way to encrypt data. Here is a good explanation of the process: <a href="https://exploringnumbertheory.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/fermats-little-theorem-and-rsa-algorithm/#:~:text=RSA%20is%20a%20cryptographic%20algorithm,original%20message%20from%20the%20sender.">ENCRYPTION</a>.</p>
