<h2>Choose your fighting style!</h2>
<p>Everyone has a way they want to fight. Do you want to be a quick, stealthy rogue? Or maybe you would prefer to be a strong but tanky knight? Whatever you want, there is a class for you.</p>

<p>There are three classes in total. These are the rogue, knight, and tank. Each of these classes fight differently:</p>

<l>
    <li>Rogue: A quick, hard hitting fighter that specializes in critical hit and speed. Use this class if you want to outspeed your opponent and kill them. However be careful, for after you attack you are left wide open for a counterattack that can certainly do some damage with your low health and defense.</li>
	<li>Knight: Armed with a righteous sword, this class excels in battle with his high attack and health. This class can deal out and take quite a bit of damage. The drawbacks to this class is having generally low speed, so you are usually getting hit first before you hit the enemy.</li>
	<li>Tank: This class can really take some damage with its high health and defense. It excels surviving hits no matter how strong they are. The drawbacks to this class is mostly its low attack, which means killing monsters might take a bit of time.</li>
</l>
