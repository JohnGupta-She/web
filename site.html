<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I've been doing competition math for a very long time now. Ever since I was a little kid, I was fascinated with the satisfaction that doing math brings. When DW asked us to write about something we had lots of experience in, there has never been a more obvious choice in my life.</p>

<h2>Competition Math</h2>
<p>There are many challenges in competition math, from speed contests to proof contests with difficult questions. There are four main subtopics in math that most problems fall under. These subtopics are Geometry, Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics. They are all difficult in their own unique ways.</p>
