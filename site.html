<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I've been doing competition math for a very long time now. Ever since I was a little kid, I was fascinated with the satisfaction that doing math brings. When DW asked us to write about something we had lots of experience in, there has never been a more obvious choice in my life.</p>
