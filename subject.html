<h2>Geometry</h2>
<p>Geometry is often tough for students because of how abstract it is. Sometimes some problems are just unsolvable unless you know a certain fact or can draw a new line that is not given to you. This kind of abstractness usually makes it daunting to some students, when often questions can be solved with simple ideas, like the pythagorean theorem.

Of course, there are much more difficult questions that need more powerful theorems and ideas, but lots of them can be solved easily by some clever solution. 
Another great part of geometry is that there is usually some sort of way to get the answer by bashing numbers and getting the answer that way. One of my favorite examples is <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2016_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_24#Solution_3_.28Trigonometry_Bash.29"> this solution </a> of problem 24 on the 2016 AMC 10A.</p>

<h2>Algebra</h2>
<p>Algebra is usally quite simple. There are a few rules and most questions are relatively clear in how you solve them. However, when algebra gets hard, it gets very hard quickly. Polynomials in particular are quite a difficult subject. One of my favorite polynomial questions is <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2010_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_6"> problem 6 from the 2010 AIME 1 </a>.</p>

<h2>Number Theory</h2>
<p>Number Theory has always been sort of a struggle for me. It has so many different ideas and concepts that are all relatively hard, so I often have trouble keeping up. It also has a lot of application in the real world, so it is really important. One famous example is the use of Fermat's little theorem and Euler's totient functions as a way to encrypt data. Here is a good explanation of the process: <a href="https://exploringnumbertheory.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/fermats-little-theorem-and-rsa-algorithm/#:~:text=RSA%20is%20a%20cryptographic%20algorithm,original%20message%20from%20the%20sender.">ENCRYPTION</a></p>

<h2>Combinatorics</h2>
<p>I also find combinatorics hard most of the time. There are some nice ways to count things, but since you can't really make sure that you are right, you have to hope that your way of counting was accurate. There are also some methods of counting that have lots of room for error, so you have to make sure that you didn't even make a little error. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqak5BArpdc&list=PLT9bNzqjDoMlKsKTUbXqgeuqWkydTqMiD&index=21">video</a> that is a good example of what I mean. This problem is taken from a very recent contest (literally 3 days ago).</p>
