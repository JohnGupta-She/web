Geometry is often tough for students because of how abstract it is. Sometimes some problems are just unsolvable unless you know a certain fact or can draw a new line that is not given to you. This kind of abstractness usually makes it daunting to some students, when often questions can be solved with simple ideas, like the pythagorean theorem. Of course, there are much more difficult questions that need more powerful theorems and ideas, but lots of them can be solved easily by some clever solution. Another great part of geometry is that there is usually some sort of way to get the answer by bashing numbers and getting the answer that way. One of my favorite examples is <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2016_AMC_10A_Problems/Problem_24#Solution_3_.28Trigonometry_Bash.29"> this solution</a> of problem 24 on the 2016 AMC 10A.</p>
