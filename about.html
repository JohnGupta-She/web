<h2>Welcome to the World!</h2>
<p>Hi! Welcome to the world of A GAME, ABOUT THINGS. The world has been swarmed by monsters and no one else is willing to stand up against them. Defeat the dragons that sit at the tope of the food chain to take back the world for the humans.</p>

<p>But to do that you are going to have to get stronger. Much stronger. First, you have to choose what you are going to specialize in. Choose a class and aim to perfect your fighting style. Defeat enemies and gain experience points to become stronger. When you feel ready, challenge a dragon.</p>

<p>Upon defeating a dragon, ancient curses will release, and your world will be propelled into the next phase. Tougher enemies will spawn and you will have to be stronger. When you gain the power necessary to defeat the final, strongest dragon challenge him and save the world.</p>

<p>We took inspiration from three different games while creating this game. These games were League of Legends, Terraria, and Pokemon.</p>
<l>
	<li>League of Legends: We got the name of the bosses, being the dragons from League. We also got some of our stat correction proceedures from how League handles its stat corrections, like with damage reduction based off of defense stat for example.</li>
	<li>Terraria: We took the general theme for the game off of Terraria's dungeon. We also took most of the death messages from Terraria, with some being original but still Terraria based. We also got the idea of the phases system and the boosts when killing a dragon from Terraria.</li>
	<li>Pokemon: We took our turn based battle system off of Pokemon. Our goal was to make the battle feel almost as similar to a Pokemon battle that we could. We also took the leveling system and idea of balancing around "stat totals" from Pokemon. </li>
