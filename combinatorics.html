<h2>Combinatorics</h2>
<p>I also find combinatorics hard most of the time. There are some nice ways to count things, but since you can't really make sure that you are right, you have to hope that your way of counting was accurate. There are also some methods of counting that have lots of room for error, so you have to make sure that you didn't even make a little error. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqak5BArpdc&list=PLT9bNzqjDoMlKsKTUbXqgeuqWkydTqMiD&index=21">video</a> that is a good example of what I mean. This problem is taken from a very recent contest (3 days ago, at the time of writing).</p>
