<h2>Algebra</h2>
<p>Algebra is usally quite simple. There are a few rules and most questions are relatively clear in how you solve them. However, when algebra gets hard, it gets very hard quickly. Polynomials in particular are quite a difficult subject. One of my favorite polynomial questions is <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2010_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_6"> problem 6 from the 2010 AIME 1</a>.</p>
